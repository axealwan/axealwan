# Hey, I’m Axel (@axealwan)

I wiped and rebuilt this GitHub—my old one felt… not me. Here’s the grown-up, focused version.

## What I’m into
- Python • TypeScript/Next.js • AI/ML
- Backend & APIs • Databases • Cloud (Vercel, GCP, AWS)
- UX with a builder’s bias: ship fast, polish continuously

## Building now
- **HealthMinion** — facial skin analysis + habit tracking (Next.js, Stripe, GCS)
- **MarinaLoop** — peer-to-peer boat charters (Supabase, Stripe)
- Automation/ops work for small businesses that actually moves the needle

## Currently learning
- Django & FastAPI patterns
- Practical CV (detection/classification) + evaluation pipelines

## Open to collaborate on
- AI-powered products that deliver real user value
- Workflow automation for clinics, trades, and SMBs
- DX tooling that reduces busywork

## Reach me
- LinkedIn: *DM me there*  
- Email: *ask and I’ll share*

> I like shipping, clean DX, and honest results. Let’s build something worth bragging about.
